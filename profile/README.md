# Welcome to SPARCS Mission!

SPARCS is a multidisciplinary mission in the form of a CubeSat, carried out by a group of undergraduate students from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), known as the [iSSS](https://github.com/orgs/SPARCS-Mission/teams/isss) team. This mission is progressing with the collaboration of [APSCO](https://www.apsco.int/) and [ISA](https://www.isa.ir/).

Developing, constructing, and testing CubeSats is a challenging endeavor, but we're on our way to space! Join us on this exciting journey, regardless of your affiliation with iSSSâ€”we welcome your contribution.
