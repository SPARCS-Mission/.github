# Welcome to SPARCS Mission!

SPARCS is a multidisciplinary mission in the form of a CubeSat, carried out by a group of undergraduate students from [SUT](https://en.sharif.edu/), known as the **iSSS** team. This mission is progressing with the collaboration of [APSCO](https://www.apsco.int/) and ISA.

Developing, constructing, and testing CubeSats is a challenging endeavor, but we're on our way to space! Join us on this exciting journey, regardless of your affiliation with iSSSâ€”we welcome your contribution.

This project includes the following general phases:
1. [Conceptual Design](https://github.com/SPARCS-Mission/Conceptual-Design)
2. [Preliminary Design](https://github.com/SPARCS-Mission/Preliminary-Design)
3. [Detailed Design](https://github.com/SPARCS-Mission/Detailed-Design)
4. Assembly, Integration & Test
5. Launch
6. In-Orbit Mission
7. Disposal

This mission is for research and technology development purposes. All data and important design files will be made available to everyone as open-source during and after the mission.
