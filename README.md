# Welcome to SPARCS Mission!

SPARCS is a completely open source CubeSat project meant for interdisciplinary team of students. We're at [Sharif University of Technology](https://www.sharif.edu/), but we have tons of collaborators including [Iranian Space Agency](https://www.isa.ir/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/), [APSCO](https://www.apsco.int/), and many more! 

We have [Oregon's first satellite in space right now](https://www.oresat.org/satellites/oresat0), and are working on two more.

Designing, building, and testing CubeSats isn't easy, but OMG we're going to space. So get involved! Even if you're not involved with PSU at all, we could use your help. 

**Here's how to [Get Started!](https://github.com/sparcs-mission/getting-started)**

Email sparcs.mission@gmail.com if you have any questions about ramping up or getting involved!
